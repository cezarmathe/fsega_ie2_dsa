# fsega_ie2_dsa

Redacted source code for exercises proposed in the Data Structures and
Algorithms laboratory.

## Usage

The `src/` directory contains a directory for each laboratory: `lab1`, `lab2`
etc.

Each of those will contain multiple files for each problem, using this naming
convention: `lab1_1.{c,h}` for the first exercise in `lab1`, `lab1_2.{c,h}` for
the second exercise in `lab1` etc.
